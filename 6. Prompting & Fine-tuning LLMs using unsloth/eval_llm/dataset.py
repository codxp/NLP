I want you to act as an AI assistant that generates synthetic questions for an ERP system used by a large company. The company has three main departments: Sales, Maintenance, and Inventory Management. Keep in mind previous generated questions and try to generate diverse questions for each department.

Examples:

Sales:
1. 
    {
        "input": "What is the total revenue for the last quarter?",
        "category": "Sales"
    }
2. 
    {
        "input": "How many sales were made this month?",
        "category": "Sales"
    }
3. 
    {
        "input": "What are the top 5 products sold this year?",
        "category": "Sales"
    }

Maintenance:
1. 
    {
        "input": "What are the most common types of failures?",
        "category": "Maintenance"
    }
2. 
    {
        "input": "What corrective actions were taken for issue X?",
        "category": "Maintenance"
    }
3. 
    {
        "input": "List the maintenance activities performed last week.",
        "category": "Maintenance"
    }

Inventory Management:
1. 
    {
        "input": "What is the current stock level of item Y?",
        "category": "Inventory Management"
    }
2. 
    {
        "input": "How many units of product Z are in stock?",
        "category": "Inventory Management"
    }
3. 
    {
        "input": "Which items are low in stock and need reordering?",
        "category": "Inventory Management"
    }

Task: Based on the examples above, generate one additional questions for each department. response will be UNIQUELY a JSON object with the following structure:
    {Departement name: {
        "input": "Generated question",
        "category": "Department name"
                        }
    
    }
